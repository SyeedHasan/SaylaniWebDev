        <p>
            The B.A.-LLB programme is split into two parts: in the first two years of the B.A. phase, students are introduced to a wide
            variety of subjects offered by the other Schools at our campus. During this stage of their studies, law students
            are exposed to concepts and ideas taken from other relevant disciplines such as history, political science and
            psychology, and are equipped with vital communication and analytical skills. The LLB phase consists of a number
            of core law subjects as prescribed by the Pakistan Bar Council, supplemented by a wide range of topical elective
            courses on specialist areas of law as well as practical skills courses, such as Moot Court and Legal Aid Clinic.
            Law students are expected to undertake summer internships at law firms, NGOs and courts. * The medium of instruction
            at LUMS is English for all degree programmes offered. Assessments are accepted in English only.</p>
